Hi, Aaryak Garg here. This is my 12th grade final project and is made according to the guidelines set by the school so the code is not pretty and could definitely be optimised.
This project is written in Python and MySQL and is a text based multiple choice quiz game which contains questions related to Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Computer Science.
I'm a complete beginner and would appreciate suggestions on how to write better code and how to implement some basic coding best practices.
Thank you guys and I hope you like this project.
